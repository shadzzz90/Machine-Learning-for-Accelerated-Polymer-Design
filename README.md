# Unofficial Implementation of "Machine Learning Strategy for Accelerated Design of Polymer Dielectrics"


## Overview

This repository provides Jupyter Notebooks as an unofficial implementation of the strategy discussed in the paper titled "Machine Learning Strategy for Accelerated Design of Polymer Dielectrics". Dive into the notebooks for an interactive exploration of polymer design powered by machine learning.

## Notebooks Structure:

1. **[Polymer Fingerprinting](link_to_notebook_1.ipynb)**: Explore how we represent polymers in an easily attainable numerical format.
   
2. **[ML Model Training](link_to_notebook_2.ipynb)**: A step-by-step guide to training our machine learning model using polymer fingerprints.



## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:

- [Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)
- Required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository and start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/repo
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the desired notebook from the Jupyter interface in your browser.
